    1.  **Termination Condition:** Concisely summarize the specific reason, circumstance, or event that permits contract termination.
        *   *Party Authorized to Terminate:* Specify which party or parties have the right to terminate under this condition.

**1. Parties to the Agreement:**
*   Identify and list each distinct legal entity recognized as a party within the contract. Provide the complete, verbatim legal name for each party as it appears in the contract. Present as a numbered list with each party's legal name in **bold**.

For each date, present the date and its corresponding significance as a distinct bullet point. Prioritize dates that are explicitly labeled with their contractual purpose within the contract text (e.g., "Commencement Date," "First Payment Date," "Review Deadline"). Output dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.

**3. Core Contractual Commitments:**
*   For each party identified in section 1, succinctly summarize their fundamental contractual commitments and obligations as expressly defined within the contract.

Prioritize clarity and conciseness, eliminating superfluous details or redundant phrasing, and emphasizing the most critical duties for each party. Organize this section by listing each party, followed by a bulleted list of their core obligations directly underneath their name.

**4. Contract Termination Provisions:**
*   Identify and meticulously detail each distinct condition under which any party is granted the unilateral right to terminate the contract. For every termination provision, present the following elements in a structured, numbered format:

    1.  **Termination Provision Summary:** Concisely summarize the precise condition, circumstance, or event that grants a party the right to terminate the contract.
        *   *Terminating Party/Parties:* Specify which party or parties are authorized to exercise the termination right under this specific condition.
