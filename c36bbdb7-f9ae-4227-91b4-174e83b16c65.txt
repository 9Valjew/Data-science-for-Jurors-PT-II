Analyze the provided contract text to extract key contractual details and present them as an easily understandable and actionable outline. Generate a clear and readable outline using bullet points or numbered lists under each category.  Critically, *summarize and synthesize* the extracted information, *rephrasing the contract's content* to demonstrate understanding and *avoid copying sentences directly*. Focus on synthesis and reinterpretation to create an easily digestible output.

Employ advanced NLP techniques including Named Entity Recognition (NER) with a location gazetteer for precise address recognition to identify names, dates, monetary amounts, and addresses. Utilize Semantic Role Labeling and Dependency Parsing to discern obligations and actions, pinpointing agents, actions, and recipients. Leverage context-aware stemming for obligation extraction, Conditional Dependency Extraction for scope, and coreference resolution for pronoun linking. Employ template-based extraction for structured data (dates, payments) and structured parsing for precise address extraction. Standardize dates to MM/DD/YYYY and convert relative dates to absolute dates where feasible. Incorporate event extraction for conditions triggered by events and dependency parsing for termination conditions related to breaches. Enhance the keyword lexicon and use semantic similarity analysis for comprehensive termination clause detection.

Specifically, identify and outline the following critical details, always prioritizing synthesis and reinterpretation:

1.  **Parties Involved:** Identify and extract the full name and address of each party using NER enhanced with a location gazetteer. Enhance role identification using a role dictionary (e.g., mapping "Lessor" to "Landlord") and role-based rules. *Utilize NER to identify and standardize names and addresses, focusing on distinguishing parties and their roles.* For each party, present their complete name, designated role, and address if specified, rephrasing and synthesizing this information without direct copying. Present as:
    *   Party Name: \[Full Name], Role: \[Role], Address: \[Address]
    If any detail is not explicitly stated, indicate "Not Specified".

2.  **Key Dates:** Extract all significant dates, including effective, commencement, expiration, and termination dates, as well as critical deadlines or milestones, using NER and template-based extraction. *Improve accuracy by mapping date phrases. Use regex and rule-based extraction to find dates.* For each date, explicitly state its contractual significance, summarizing and rephrasing the significance. Standardize all dates to MM/DD/YYYY format, converting relative dates (e.g., "30 days after effective date") to absolute dates where possible using contextual understanding and arithmetic reasoning. Output as:
    *   Date: \[MM/DD/YYYY], Significance: \[Significance]
    If either the date or its significance is not explicitly stated, indicate "Not Specified".

3.  **Material Obligations of Each Party:** For each party, *summarize* their essential contractual obligations, focusing on core 'must-do' actions, deliverables, and commitments critical for the contract's execution. Utilize semantic role labeling, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and context-aware stemming to identify agents, actions, and patients in obligation clauses. Determine conditional dependencies and scope using Conditional Dependency Extraction. Incorporate intent analysis to capture the core meaning of obligations. *Apply semantic parsing. Focus on sentences containing obligation keywords like "must," "shall," or "agree."* List these obligations distinctly under each party's name, *rephrasing and synthesizing the contract's wording* without direct copying.
    **\[Party Name]:**
    *   \[Obligation 1]
    *   \[Obligation 2]
    *   ...
    If a material obligation is not explicitly stated for a party, indicate "Not Specified". For unclear obligations, mark them for human review.

4.  **Termination Conditions:** Identify and list all conditions under which the contract can be terminated, whether by any party or due to circumstances. Provide a concise description for each termination condition, *rephrasing the contract language* to explain the triggering event and requirements without direct copying. Employ semantic similarity analysis and enhance the keyword lexicon for comprehensive detection of termination clauses. Use a dependency parser for breach-related terminations and event extraction for deadline-related terminations. *Utilize machine learning techniques like sequence labeling for enhanced termination clause detection.* Output as:
    *   \[Termination Condition Description]
    If no termination conditions are explicitly stated, indicate "Not Specified". For implied conditions, prompt for clarification or use chain-of-thought reasoning to infer conditions where appropriate.

*Advice for Implementation:*
- Enhance NER using a domain-specific dictionary for legal entities and roles.
- Implement date normalization using regular expressions and rule-based systems.
- Improve obligation extraction using a combination of syntactic parsing and semantic role labeling.
- Use a dependency parser for identifying triggers.
- Develop an information extraction to capture specific payment terms.
- Use semantic similarity to identify termination clauses.
----ADVICE----
*   Improve NER for legal entities using domain-specific dictionaries.

*   Combine parsing with semantic role labeling for obligation extraction.

*   Use a dependency parser to identify triggering terms.

*   Develop information extraction focused on payment terms.

*   Apply semantic similarity for comprehensive termination clause detection.
